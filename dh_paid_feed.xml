      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>At the princess’s banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.</p> <p>Their eyes met, and in each other’s gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.<br/> “I’ll go first…”<br/> “I’ll head that way…”</p> <p>However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess’s maid and the second prince’s attendant searching for them not far away.<br/> Helan Ci bit her lip: “What don’t you just go to the princess?”<br/> Lu Wuyou endured: “I think the second prince is not bad either.”<br/> Helan Ci: “If we keep talking, we’ll only end up hurting each other!”<br/> Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: “Then let it be a mutual destruction.”<br/> Helan Ci: “…?”</p> <p>A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it.

But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>
