      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to.

I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively.

She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.</p> <p>The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince’s long-cherished “white moonlight”. Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince’s mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead’s white moonlight.</p> <p>Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: “No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day.”</p> <p>So when the male lead said: “I want to marry my white moonlight.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.</p> <p>The male lead said: “She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I’ll have her live next to me!</p> <p>The male lead said: “She’s too considerate. She won’t speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!</p> <p>••••</p> <p>The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.</p> <p>Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don’t go. Would you stay?</p> <p>A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don’t leave.</p> <p>Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead’s heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.</p> <p>The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his “white moonlight,” take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, “Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han.”</p> <p>The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: “Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?”</p> <p>#My harem seems to have turned into my princess’s, what should I do#</p> <p>#Is it too late to regret now#</p> <p>One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk.

She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups.

Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it.

Would you stay?</p> <p>A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don’t leave.</p> <p>Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead’s heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.</p> <p>The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his “white moonlight,” take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, “Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han.”</p> <p>The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: “Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?”</p> <p>#My harem seems to have turned into my princess’s, what should I do#</p> <p>#Is it too late to regret now#</p> <p>One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean?

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!</p> <p>With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!</p> <p>She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”</p> <p>She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”</p> <p>She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”</p> <p>Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”</p> <p>Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/giving-interstellar-players-a-horror-ghost-game-shock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.</p> <p>The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince’s long-cherished “white moonlight”. Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince’s mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead’s white moonlight.</p> <p>Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: “No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day.”</p> <p>So when the male lead said: “I want to marry my white moonlight.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.</p> <p>The male lead said: “She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I’ll have her live next to me!</p> <p>The male lead said: “She’s too considerate. She won’t speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!</p> <p>••••</p> <p>The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.</p> <p>Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don’t go. Would you stay?</p> <p>A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don’t leave.</p> <p>Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead’s heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.</p> <p>The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his “white moonlight,” take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, “Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han.”</p> <p>The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: “Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?”</p> <p>#My harem seems to have turned into my princess’s, what should I do#</p> <p>#Is it too late to regret now#</p> <p>One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.</p> </div>]]></description>

Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.</p> <p>The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince’s long-cherished “white moonlight”. Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince’s mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead’s white moonlight.</p> <p>Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: “No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day.”</p> <p>So when the male lead said: “I want to marry my white moonlight.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.</p> <p>The male lead said: “She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I’ll have her live next to me!</p> <p>The male lead said: “She’s too considerate. She won’t speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!</p> <p>••••</p> <p>The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.</p> <p>Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don’t go. Would you stay?</p> <p>A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don’t leave.</p> <p>Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead’s heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.</p> <p>The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his “white moonlight,” take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, “Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han.”</p> <p>The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: “Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?”</p> <p>#My harem seems to have turned into my princess’s, what should I do#</p> <p>#Is it too late to regret now#</p> <p>One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.</p> <p>The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince’s long-cherished “white moonlight”. Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince’s mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead’s white moonlight.</p> <p>Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: “No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day.”</p> <p>So when the male lead said: “I want to marry my white moonlight.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.</p> <p>The male lead said: “She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I’ll have her live next to me!</p> <p>The male lead said: “She’s too considerate. She won’t speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her.”</p> <p>Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!</p> <p>••••</p> <p>The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.</p> <p>Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don’t go. Would you stay?</p> <p>A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don’t leave.</p> <p>Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead’s heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.</p> <p>The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his “white moonlight,” take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, “Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han.”</p> <p>The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: “Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?”</p> <p>#My harem seems to have turned into my princess’s, what should I do#</p> <p>#Is it too late to regret now#</p> <p>One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>*This story contains themes of coercive relationships and uncomfortable subjects.</p> <p>A child was on the way.<br/> We loved each other, were happy together, and dreamed of a future as a family.<br/> But on the way to the obstetrician to meet the baby, an unexpected accident occurred.<br/> Due to the accident, Dokwon didn’t open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to…<br/> “Omega?”<br/> He didn’t remember me.</p> <p>But I was okay. We loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could return to that time.<br/> Dokwon’s words hurt, but I could endure it. I could bear it.<br/> “You’ll regret this.”<br/> “Me? What will I regret?”<br/> “Talking to me like that.”<br/> “What?”<br/> “Treating me poorly. Treating me like a gold digger. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who only emits pheromones. You’ll regret it later.”</p> <p>But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge.<br/> And finally,<br/> “Let’s end this here.”<br/> “…What?”<br/> “Get rid of the baby.”<br/> “…What did you say?”<br/> “Let’s end this without causing any more disgrace. Eunsoo Yoo.”<br/> The end tore us apart.</p> <p>Left standing alone at the end… I fervently wished for death.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

One day, due to his father’s arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller…</p> <p>“…Ah, I got it right this time?

If he’s an alpha, he might even be traumatized.”</p> <p>In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome.

One day, due to his father’s arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller…</p> <p>“…Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I’ll use this for my fiancé. What of it?” Ian’s voice continued soothingly. “Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he’s an alpha, he might even be traumatized.”</p> <p>In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Noah, a masochist who enjoys pain. One day, due to his father’s arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller…</p> <p>“…Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I’ll use this for my fiancé. What of it?” Ian’s voice continued soothingly. “Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he’s an alpha, he might even be traumatized.”</p> <p>In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!</p> </div>]]></description>

One day, due to his father’s arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller…</p> <p>“…Ah, I got it right this time?

That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there’s a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a ‘stud’ in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there’s a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a ‘stud’ in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there’s a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a ‘stud’ in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Synopsis:</p> <p>Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.</p> <p>Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.</p> <p>To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.</p> <p>To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:</p> <p>* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.</p> <p>* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.</p> <p>* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she… broke them up!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.</p> <p>Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.</p> <p>Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister’s thoughts:</p> <p>“OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!”</p> <p>“My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!”</p> <p>“Senior sister, don’t be so saintly. You’ll be bullied by bad people!”</p> <p>The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I’d rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! … My junior sister is so cute, I’m so into her.</p> <p>A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord</p> <p>1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there’s a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a ‘stud’ in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?</p> </div>]]></description>

She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.</p> <p>Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.</p> <p>To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.</p> <p>To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:</p> <p>* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.</p> <p>* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.</p> <p>* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she… broke them up!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.</p> <p>Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life.

I can do this!”</p> <p>“My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!”</p> <p>“Senior sister, don’t be so saintly.

However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.</p> <p>To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:</p> <p>* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.</p> <p>* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.</p> <p>* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she… broke them up!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.</p> <p>Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.</p> <p>Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister’s thoughts:</p> <p>“OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!”</p> <p>“My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!”</p> <p>“Senior sister, don’t be so saintly. You’ll be bullied by bad people!”</p> <p>The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I’d rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! … My junior sister is so cute, I’m so into her.</p> <p>A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord</p> <p>1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet</p> </div>]]></description>

In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.</p> <p>To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.</p> <p>Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!</p> <p>However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?</p> <p>••••</p> <p>Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.</p> <p>Wen Zhao: ???</p> <p>She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.</p> <p>Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.</p> <p>She asked softly, “A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?”</p> <p>Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!</p> <p>••••</p> <p>One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I’m with the female lead now.</p> <p>Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.</p> </div>]]></description>
