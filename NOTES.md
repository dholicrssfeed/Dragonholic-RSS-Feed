Guide for Updating Novel/Translator Mappings
This guide explains which elements you need to update whenever a new novel or translator is added. Please ensure you update the following sections in dh_mappings.py accordingly:

1. Translator to Novel Mapping
File: dh_mappings.py

Variable: TRANSLATOR_NOVEL_MAP

Instructions:

Add the translator's name as a new key if it doesn't exist.
Under that key, list all novel titles (as strings) for that translator.
Example:

TRANSLATOR_NOVEL_MAP = {
    "Existing Translator": [
        "Existing Novel Title"
    ],
    "New Translator": [
        "New Novel Title 1",
        "New Novel Title 2"
    ]
}

2. Discord Role ID Mapping
File: dh_mappings.py

Variable: DISCORD_ROLE_ID_MAP

Instructions:

Add or update the Discord role ID corresponding to the translator.
Format each role ID as a string (e.g., "<@&123456789012345678>").
Example:

DISCORD_ROLE_ID_MAP = {
    "Existing Translator": "<@&ExistingRoleID>",
    "New Translator": "<@&NewRoleID>"
}

3. Novel URL Overrides
File: dh_mappings.py

Variable: NOVEL_URL_OVERRIDES

Instructions:

If the default URL generated by the slug function is not correct, add an override here.
The key should be the exact novel title and the value is the correct URL.
Example:

NOVEL_URL_OVERRIDES = {
    "Help others? It’s better to help yourself": "https://dragonholic.com/novel/helping-others-its-better-to-help-yourself/",
    "New Novel Title": "https://dragonholic.com/novel/new-novel-title/"
}

4. Featured Image URLs
File: dh_mappings.py

Function: get_featured_image(title)

Instructions:

Update or add a new if statement for the new novel so that it returns the correct image URL.
Example:

def get_featured_image(title):
    if "New Novel Title" in title:
        return "https://dragonholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/new-novel-cover.jpg"
    # ... existing conditions ...
    return ""
    
5. NSFW Novel List
File: dh_mappings.py

Function: get_nsfw_novels()

Instructions:

If the new novel is NSFW, add its title (exactly as it appears in TRANSLATOR_NOVEL_MAP) to the list returned by this function.
Example:

def get_nsfw_novels():
    return [
        "Bondage and Marriage",
        "Clap",
        "Double Junk",
        "My Bloody Valentine",
        # ... existing NSFW novels ...
        "New NSFW Novel Title"  # Add here if applicable
    ]
